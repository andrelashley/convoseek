    <h3>Step 2: Prepare Your Files</h3>
    <p>
        After exporting your data, you’ll receive compressed files (e.g., a ZIP file). You need to extract these files before uploading them to ConvoSeek. Here’s how to handle the extracted files:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Facebook Messenger:</strong> You’ll see a list of JSON files, one for each conversation. Select the specific file for the conversation you wish to upload.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>WhatsApp:</strong> You’ll receive a text file for each conversation you export. Upload the text file directly to ConvoSeek.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Step 3: Upload Your Files</h3>
    <p>
        Go to the <strong>Upload Messages</strong> page on ConvoSeek and select the appropriate file for uploading. Ensure that the file matches the format specified for Facebook Messenger (JSON) or WhatsApp (TXT).
    </p>

    <h3>Step 4: Start Searching</h3>
    <p>
        Once your data has been successfully uploaded, you can start searching through your messages using the <a asp-controller="Search" asp-action="Index">Search</a> page. Simply enter your query, and ConvoSeek will find the relevant messages for you.
